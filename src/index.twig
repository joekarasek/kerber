"text": ["We offer several sedation dentistry options depending on your child’s needs and how much treatment is needed. Nitrous oxide is a safe, effective option for children who are apprehensive about treatment and quickly dissipates with normal breathing after the treatment completes."
,"Conscious sedation is recommended for apprehensive children, very young children, or children with special needs. It is used to calm your child and reduce anxiety or discomfort associated with dental treatments. Your child will be quite drowsy and may even fall asleep but they will not become unconscious."
,"Outpatient General Anesthesia is recommended for those children who conscious sedation treatment won’t work or who have extensive needs. This treatment is performed in a hospital or outpatient setting only."

,"A professional dental cleaning will include removing plaque from teeth, removing calculus (tarter) above the gum line. Calculus below the gum line indicates gum disease and requires a different procedure to remove it."]

,"Composite fillings are more than just attractive. They require minimal tooth preparation, in other words less healthy tooth structure is removed to restore the tooth. Also, a sealant can be placed over the remaining exposed grooves of the tooth to minimize the risk of decay on another area of the tooth."]

These items include cysts, cancerous and non-cancerous tumors, invisible decay that occurs between teeth, and the location of teeth that haven't grown all the way in."
,"Modern dental x-ray machines are very safe. We use only state-of-the-art, low radiation machines. The amount of radiation exposure your child's body receives on an airplane flight from Los Angeles to New York exceeds the amount of exposure they will receive from a modern dental x-ray machine. Contrast this minimal exposure with the risk of not finding an illness until it is too late, and you can see why we prescribe regular diagnostic x-rays."]

We also recommend the use of modern electric tooth brushes such as Sonicare and Braun. Floss daily to remove plaque between teeth that you can't reach with regular brushing."
,"Always rinse thoroughly with water after brushing (or after meals if you are unable to brush). You may occasionally use a mouthwash to rinse. Children may benefit from the use of ACT fluoride rinse, to help prevent cavities from forming in between the teeth."]
